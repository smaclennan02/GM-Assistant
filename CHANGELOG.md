### Added
- Monsters page: **Add N copies** with **auto-numbering** (Goblin #1…#N).

### Added

### Changed
- Tracker Effects: “+” now opens a **cursor-anchored popover** with a compact icon grid and search.

## [0.1.12] – 2025-08-23
### Added
- **Tracker QoL**:
  - Inline **d20 roll** on each combatant; uses PC **initMod** when present (or +0).

### Notes

## [0.1.11] – 2025-08-23
### Fixed
- Tracker Effects picker: guarded missing icons to prevent “Element type is invalid” crash.

### Changed
- Tracker effects are now **icon-only** with hover tooltips (no text chips).
### Added

## [0.1.8] – 2025-08-23
### Added
- **Resources v1** page:
  - **Conditions**: searchable reference with concise rules summaries.
  - **Party Rest**: per-PC Short Rest / Long Rest actions with timestamps.
  - **Exhaustion**: per-PC level 0–6 with level descriptions.

### Added
- **Tracker: Conditions** — per-combatant condition chips (Prone, Grappled, Poisoned, etc.) with tooltips; click to remove.

### Notes

## [0.1.6] – 2025-08-23
### Added
- Encounters hub redesign: single header + three link-cards (Tracker, Builder, Monsters) for a cleaner entry point.
### Improved
- Global readability polish: zebra rows, hover highlight, sticky table headers, compact inputs, focus rings, nicer scrollbars.
- Tracker: auto-load PCs on first open if encounter is empty; denser header with padding and grouped controls.

## [0.1.2] – 2025-08-22
### Added
- Storage primitives: `useStorageState`, `localDriver`, namespaced `STORAGE_KEYS`.
